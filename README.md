# My-Portfolio
## Purpose
The purpose of this webpage is to show-off the work I have done thus far. As well as building a template for future projects. </br>
I of course plan to add to this portfolio and make it look even better as my experience with coding increases and I am very excited to go down that path! </br>
Throughout the portfolio I ensured that the header would stay fixed so the user may navigate throughout the webpage no matter how far they scroll down. </br>
I did decide to include my resume. However, it is diplaying my current job position due to the fact I have no coding experience yet or I don't feel like i have anything quantifiable enough to put on a resume pertaining to software. </br>
I ensured the webpage is responsive. It did look ok in most layouts on phones and tablets so my media queries were minimal.</br>
Whenever the user selects an image they are taken to the deployed webpage so that they may view the webpage or code in its entirety. For now there is a placeholder taking the user to google until I complete more work. </br>
Thank you for checking out my webpage!
